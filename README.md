# FSI-Radio-Telescope-Project
This repository contains all the work I did to further the progress of this project 

The goal of this project is to reduce human-generated / 5G noise picked up by radio telescopes.

High-Dynamic-Range Receiver Systems: Designed to enhance sensitivity and operate effectively in a spectrum-sharing environment.
RFI Mitigation Techniques: Strategies to reduce interference from active services.
Experimental Setup: A 4-channel voltage recording system with a bandwidth of ~120 MHz, utilizing RFSoC FPGA technology.
Key Components
Data Acquisition: Capable of recording from telescopes and reference antennas.
Test Sites: Malabar, Florida, and Arecibo Observatory.
Objectives
To develop and implement real-time RFI mitigation strategies, advancing the field of radio astronomy in dynamic environments.
