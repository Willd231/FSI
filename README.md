#FSI Radio Telescope Project

This repository contains my contributions to advancing the FSI Radio Telescope Project, with a primary focus on reducing human-generated and 5G interference in radio astronomy.

Project Overview

The project explores techniques and systems designed to improve radio telescope performance in challenging spectrum-sharing environments.

Key Areas of Work

High-Dynamic-Range Receiver Systems

Built to maximize sensitivity and maintain performance in noisy frequency environments.

RFI Mitigation Techniques

Development of methods to minimize interference from active services (e.g., 5G).

Experimental Setup

4-channel voltage recording system (~120 MHz bandwidth) using RFSoC FPGA technology.

Core Components

Data Acquisition

Records signals from telescopes and reference antennas.

Test Sites

Malabar, Florida

Arecibo Observatory

Objectives

Develop and implement real-time RFI mitigation strategies.

Advance techniques for radio astronomy in increasingly dynamic and interference-prone environments.
