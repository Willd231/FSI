This directory contains all of the work I have done with plotting in order to analyze data. The two folders within are an exemplar of my coding progress. The first: DLITE, is the work I did as a first
year computer science student analyzing the data given to us from the Malabar radio telescope site in Melbourne, FL 
The second: Carse, is the work I have done as a second year analyzing the data we created in the lab in order to establish concrete signal processing methods
